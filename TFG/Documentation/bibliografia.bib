    abstract = { Emerging changes in health-care delivery are having a significant impact on the structure of health-care professionals' education. Today it is recognized that medical knowledge doubles every 6–8 years, with new medical procedures emerging everyday. While the half-life of medical information is so short, the average physician practices 30 years and the average nurse 40 years. Continuing education thus represents an important challenge to face. Recent advances in educational technology are offering an increasing number of innovative learning tools. Among these, Virtual Reality represents a promising area with high potential of enhancing the training of health-care professionals. Virtual Reality Training can provide a rich, interactive, engaging educational context, thus supporting experiential learning-by-doing; it can, in fact, contribute to raise interest and motivation in trainees and to effectively support skills acquisition and transfer, since the learning process can be settled within an experiential framework. Current virtual training applications for health-care differ a lot as to both their technological/multimedia sophistication and to the types of skills trained, varying for example from telesurgical applications to interactive simulations of human body and brain, to virtual worlds for emergency training. Other interesting applications include the development of immersive 3D environments for training psychiatrists and psychologists in the treatment of mental disorders. This paper has the main aim of discussing the rationale and main benefits for the use of virtual reality in health-care education and training. Significant research and projects carried out in this field will also be presented, followed by discussion on key issues concerning current limitations and future development directions. }

  abstract={Representing users’ hands and fingers in virtual reality is crucial for many tasks. Recently, virtual reality head-mounted displays, capable of camera-based inside-out tracking and finger and hand tracking, are becoming popular and complement add-on solutions, such as Leap Motion.However, interacting with physical objects requires an accurate grounded positioning of the virtual reality coordinate system relative to relevant objects, and a good spatial positioning of the user’s fingers and hands.In order to get a better understanding of the capabilities of Virtual Reality headset finger tracking solutions for interacting with physical objects, we ran a controlled experiment (n =24) comparing two commodity hand and finger tracking systems (HTC Vive and Leap Motion) and report on the accuracy of commodity hand tracking systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Augmented reality and virtual reality technologies are increasing in popularity. Augmented reality has thrived to date mainly on mobile applications, with games like Pok&eacute;mon Go or the new Google Maps utility as some of its ambassadors. On the other hand, virtual reality has been popularized mainly thanks to the videogame industry and cheaper devices. However, what was initially a failure in the industrial field is resurfacing in recent years thanks to the technological improvements in devices and processing hardware. In this work, an in-depth study of the different fields in which augmented and virtual reality have been used has been carried out. This study focuses on conducting a thorough scoping review focused on these new technologies, where the evolution of each of them during the last years in the most important categories and in the countries most involved in these technologies will be analyzed. Finally, we will analyze the future trend of these technologies and the areas in which it is necessary to investigate to further integrate these technologies into society.},

  abstract={This tutorial will provide an introduction to Unity (http://www.unity3D.com) and several VR components that are designed to work with Unity. These VR components can be used in isolation or pieced together to provide fully immersive VR experiences. Unity is a feature rich multi-platform game engine for the creation of interactive 3D content. It includes an intuitive interface while at the same time allowing low-level access for developers. Thousands of assets provided by other content creators can be reused to quickly develop immersive experiences. Because of its intuitive interface, well designed architecture, and ability to easily reuse assets, 3D software can be developed in a fraction of time compared to traditional development. Consumer-level virtual-reality hardware combined with Unity have recently empowered hobbyists, professionals, and academics to quickly create virtual reality applications. Because of Unity's widespread use and ease of use, several virtual reality companies now fully support Unity. During this tutorial, participants will learn how to quickly build virtual reality applications from some of the leaders of Unity virtual reality development. Attendees will gain an understanding of how to use multiple VR components with Unity and will have enough knowledge to start building VR applications using Unity by the end of the tutorial.},

ABSTRACT={This study aimed to discuss the research efforts in developing virtual reality (VR) technology for different training applications. To begin with, we describe how VR training experiences are typically created and delivered using the current software and hardware. We then discuss the challenges and solutions of applying VR training to different application domains, such as first responder training, medical training, military training, workforce training, and education. Furthermore, we discuss the common assessment tests and evaluation methods used to validate VR training effectiveness. We conclude the article by discussing possible future directions to leverage VR technology advances for developing novel training experiences.}
